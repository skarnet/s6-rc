<h1> An overview of s6-rc </h1>

<h2> A manager for <em>services</em> </h2>

<p>
 s6-rc is a service manager, or, in other words, a
<em>machine state manager</em>: given a database of services,
with dependencies between them, it can safely bring the
<em>global machine state</em>, or <em>live state</em>, to
the desired point, making sure dependencies are never
broken.
</p>

<h3> The live state </h3>

<p>
 The <em>live state</em>, by definition, is the tuple of
all service states on the machine. Changing the live state
means bringing services up, or bringing services down.
</p>

<h3> Two and a half kinds of services </h3>

<p>
 Supervision suites manage <em>long-lived processes</em>, a.k.a
<em>daemons</em>, and sometimes call them <em>services</em>.
With s6-rc, things are a little different: a long-lived process is
also called a <em>longrun</em> and is a service, but a service
does not have to be a longrun. There is a second kind of service,
which is called a <em>oneshot</em>, and which represents a change
of system state that is not embodied by the presence of a
long-lived process. For instance, "mounting a filesystem" is a
system state change, but in most cases there is no process hanging
around while the filesystem is mounted.
</p>

<p>
 s6-rc handles both oneshots and longruns.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> A <em>longrun</em> is the exact equivalent of a <em>service</em>
in the supervision sense. It is defined by a
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">service
directory</a>, with a run script and optional other data. The
service is considered <em>up</em> as long as the long-lived
process is alive and, for daemons that support it, has
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/notifywhenup.html">notified
its readiness</a>. It is considered <em>down</em> otherwise. </li>
 <li> A <em>oneshot</em>, on the other hand, is totally unknown
from supervision suites, because there is no daemon to manage.
A oneshot is represented by two short-lived scripts, <em>up</em>
and <em>down</em>, used to bring the service respectively up and
down. The service is considered up when the <em>up</em>
program has exited successfully, and until the <em>down</em>
program has exited successfully. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Services can depend on one another.
If service <em>A</em> has been declared as
depending on service <em>B</em>, then s6-rc will make sure to
never start <em>A</em> until it knows that <em>B</em> is up,
and will make sure to never stop <em>B</em> until it knows that
<em>A</em> is down. This works whether <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
are both oneshots, both longruns, or a oneshot and a longrun.
</p>

<p>
 Oneshots and longruns are called <em>atomic services</em>.
By opposition to atomic services, s6-rc also handles an
additional kind of service that it calls a <em>bundle</em>.
A bundle is just a collection of atomic services, described
under a single name. A bundle definition can even contain other
bundles, but ultimately a bundle will always represent a set of one
or more atomic services.
Bundle names can be used anywhere with the s6-rc user
interface, and they will internally be converted to a set of
atomic services. An atomic service can depend on a bundle: it will
simply depend on all the atomic services represented by the bundle.
A bundle, however, cannot have dependencies.
</p>

<h2> A two-part operation </h2>

<p>
 Unlike other service managers such as
<a href="https://jjacky.com/anopa/">anopa</a>, s6-rc separates the
work of analyzing a set of service definitions, resolving
dependencies, and so on, from the work of actually applying the
dependency graph to perform live state changes. The former is
the <em>compilation</em> phase, and is done offline; the latter is
the <em>live</em> phase, and is of course done online - it impacts
the actual state of the machine.
</p>

<h3> The compilation phase </h3>

<ul>
 <li> Users are expected to write their service definitions - be it
oneshots, longruns or bundles - in one or more
<em>source directories</em>, in the s6-rc
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html#source">source format</a>.
The source format is simple to parse automatically - which is
one of the main reasons why it has been designed that way - and
it is also simple to generate automatically: it is easy to write
converters from a given service definition format to the s6-rc
source format. </li>
 <li> Users then run the
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> program, that takes
a set of service definitions in one or more source directories
and makes a <em>compiled service database</em>, abbreviated as
<em>compiled</em>. This <em>compiled</em> should be stored by the
administrator on the root filesystem. </li>
 <li> The <a href="s6-rc-db.html">s6-rc-db</a> tool can be used
to examine compiled service databases and extract information from
them in a human-friendly format. </li>
</ul>

<h3> The live phase </h3>

<p>
 When the machine boots up:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> First, the chosen init should make sure that a
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/">s6</a>
supervision tree is up and running. s6-rc will only work
if there is an active
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>
process monitoring a
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/scandir.html">scan
directory</a>. On Linux, for instance, it is possible to achieve such a state
by using an init created by the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a>
tool: when control reaches stage 2, s6-svscan is guaranteed to run,
so using s6-rc in the stage 2 script is the way to go. </li>
 <li> The boot process, let's name it <em>stage2</em>, should then call the
<a href="s6-rc-init.html">s6-rc-init</a> program. This program
will set up an area for s6-rc in a writable directory (which can
be on a RAM filesystem such as tmpfs) to host its live information
such as the machine state, a working copy of all service directories
for longruns, and a link to the current compiled state database.
<a href="s6-rc-init.html">s6-rc-init</a> initializes the machine state
as "every declared service is down". </li>
 <li> <em>stage2</em> should then invoke the
<a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a> program (<tt>s6-rc change</tt>) with, as
arguments, the names of the services that
should be brought up. Of course, bundles can be used
for shortcuts. </li>
 <li> That's it, the services are up and the initialization should be
over. If the service database has been properly written, a <em>stage2</em>
script can actually be really short: an invocation of
<a href="s6-rc-init.html">s6-rc-init</a> and an invocation of
<a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Other state changes and shutdown </h3>

<p>
 The administrator can make changes to the live state of the machine
by manually calling <a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a> again with the
proper arguments. This is more powerful than the old
<a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/run-levels-intro.html">runlevels</a>:
it is possible to change the live state to <em>any</em> set of
services, not only predefined ones. The only thing that s6-rc will
not allow is a state that would break service dependencies; it
will always respect the dependency graph.
</p>

<p>
 The s6-rc command is the engine for machine state changes, and it is
also true for shutdown. When shutting a machine down, all the services
managed by s6-rc should be brought down in the proper order (via the
<tt>s6-rc -da change</tt> command). Once all those services have been
brought down successfully, the final shutdown procedure can take place;
for instance, if s6-svscan is running as process 1 with the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/">s6-linux-init</a>
defaults, <tt>s6-svscanctl -6 /run/service</tt> will kill the
supervision tree and call <tt>/etc/rc.shutdown reboot</tt>, which should
reboot the machine.
</p>

<h2> Live updates to the service database </h2>

<p>
The s6-rc command is a one-stop shop for service management as long as
the compiled database doesn't change. If an administrator wishes to
make a new compiled database the current live one, without rebooting
the machine, a bit more work is needed, and that's the job of the
<a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> command. This command
has been specifically written with Unix distributions in mind: when
new packages ship, they come with new service definitions, or upgraded
ones, and it is necessary to compile a new service database and update
the live state so it matches; if source definitions for s6-rc are
provided in the packages, an invocation of
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> followed by an invocation of
<a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> should be all it takes to
keep the live state up to date.
</p>

<h2> Live bundle modifications </h2>

<p>
 It is possible to change bundle definitions in a compiled service
database, including the live one, without recompiling everything by
calling <a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>. The
<a href="s6-rc-bundle.html">s6-rc-bundle</a> tool can edit compiled
databases to add bundles to them, or delete bundles from them.
</p>

<h2> Management of source definition directories <h2>

<p>
 Starting with version 0.6.0.0, s6-rc provides tools to help users
and distributions &mdash; typically using a package manager &mdash;
organize their source definition directories and their compiled
service databases. This is known as the "repo" subset of the s6-rc
programs, identifiable by their names starting with <tt>s6-rc-repo-</tt>
and <tt>s6-rc-set</tt>. The key concepts behind these programs and
links to their documentation are listed
<a href="repodefs.html">here</a>.
