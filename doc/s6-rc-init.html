<h1> The s6-rc-init program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-init is an initialization tool for the s6-rc
system. It must be run as root, at boot time, prior to any
invocation of the
<a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a> binary.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-init [ -c <em>compiled</em> ] [ -l <em>live</em> ] [ -p <em>prefix</em> ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] [ -b ] [ -d ] <em>scandir</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <em>compiled</em> (if the <tt>-d</tt> option hasn't been given),
<em>live</em> and <em>scandir</em> must be absolute paths. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init expects to find a <em>compiled service database</em>
in <em>compiled</em>. It expects to be able to create a directory
named <em>live</em>. It also expects that an instance of
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>
is running on <em>scandir</em>. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init initializes the live state in <em>live</em>. It
declares <em>compiled</em> as the current service database and
sets the state as "all services down". </li>
 <li> It then copies verbatim all
the service directories declared by <em>compiled</em> into a
subdirectory of <em>live</em>, adds <tt>./down</tt> files to the live copies
and links those live copies into <em>scandir</em>. It then triggers
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>,
which will pick up the new service directories and start
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-supervise.html">s6-supervise</a>
processes on them - but the service themselves will not be started
right away, because of the <tt>./down</tt> files. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-init waits for all s6-supervise processes to be
operational, then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>timeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if all
s6-supervise processes are not up and running after <em>timeout</em>
milliseconds, s6-rc-init will complain and exit 111. This is a
safety feature so s6-rc-init doesn't hang indefinitely on a
nonworking installation; normally this initialization should not take
more than a few milliseconds. </li>
 <li> <tt>-c&nbsp;<em>compiled</em></tt>&nbsp;: declare <em>compiled</em>
as the current compiled service database for the upcoming live state.
Default is <tt>/etc/s6-rc/compiled</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-l&nbsp;<em>live</em></tt>&nbsp;: Store the live state into
the <em>live</em> directory, which should not exist prior to running
s6-rc-init, but should be under a writable filesystem - likely a RAM
filesystem. Default is
<tt>/run/s6-rc</tt>. The default can be changed at compile time by
giving the <tt>--livedir=<em>live</em></tt> option to
<tt>./configure</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-p&nbsp;<em>prefix</em></tt>&nbsp;: when linking all the
service directory into <em>scandir</em>, prepend the symbolic link
names with <em>prefix</em>, i.e. a longrun named <tt>A</tt> will
have its service directory accessible via
<tt><em>scandir</em>/<em>prefix</em>A</tt>.
This allows several live directories
to be used with a unique scandir without risking conflicts between
longruns with the same name from different service databases.
This option is only useful if you intend to have several sets of services
independently managed by s6-rc, with different live directories, all
using the same scandir to supervise their longruns. The default is no
prefix at all, which is good when you only have one live directory. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;: blocking lock. If the database is currently
being used by another program, s6-rc-init will wait until that
other program has released its lock on the database, then proceed.
By default, s6-rc-init fails with an error message if the database
is currently in use. </li>
 <li><tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;: dereference <em>compiled</em>. Fully resolve
the <em>compiled</em> path before declaring it as the current
compiled service database for the upcoming live state. This allows
<em>compiled</em> to be a symlink that can be updated later without
impacting the current live state. Using this flag in your init scripts'
<tt>s6-rc-init</tt> invocation means that it's possible to boot on a
compiled service database whose validity has not previously been
guaranteed by a successful <a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a>
invocation: you should know what you are doing. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Typical usage </h2>

<p>
 Administrators should invoke <tt>s6-rc-init</tt> once, in their
early boot scripts, after s6-svscan is functional and ready to
supervise longrun services (and after its catch-all logger, if
any, has started), but before any
other initialization. (The rest of the initialization can be
written as a set of s6-rc services, and performed by just one
invocation of the <a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc change</a> command.)
</p>

<p>
 For instance, when using an init created by
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/">s6-linux-init</a>,
<tt>s6-rc-init</tt> should be the first command in the
<em>stage2</em> (by default <tt>/etc/rc.init</tt>) script.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The directory created by s6-rc-init will actually be called
<em>live</em><tt>:initial</tt>, and <em>live</em> will be a symbolic
link to that directory. Users should ignore this, and always refer
to the live directory as <em>live</em> in their future
<a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc</a> or <a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a>
invocations. The reason for this behaviour is that
<a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a> creates another,
similarly named, directory (<em>live</em><tt>:<em>suffix</em></tt>)
and updates the live state by atomically changing the target of the
<em>live</em> symlink - so <em>live</em> will not change names, whereas
the real directory may. </li>
 <li> Similarly, it is recommended that administrators store their
compiled service databases into some versioned directory, and that
<em>compiled</em> be a symbolic link to the database currently in
use. This will make it easier to create new compiled databases and
switch them with <a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a>
without having to change the s6-rc-init invocation in boot scripts. </li>
 <li> After s6-rc-init runs, <em>compiled</em> has become the
"live compiled database", and must not be tampered with or deleted.
The only way to free it for deletion is to replace it with another
database, via a call to <a href="s6-rc-update.html">s6-rc-update</a>. </li>
</ul>
