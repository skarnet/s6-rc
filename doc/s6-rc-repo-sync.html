<h1> The s6-rc-repo-sync program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-repo-sync synchronizes a <a href="repodefs.html#repository">repository</a>,
which means making an up-to-date <a href="repodefs.html#refdb">reference
database</a>, and ensuring that all defined
<a href="repodefs.html#set">sets</a> include all the services in the
repository's stores, and only them.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-repo-sync [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -r <em>repo</em> ] [ -h <em>fdhuser</em> ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-rc-repo-sync looks at all the services defined in the repository's
<a href="repodefs.html#store">stores</a>, and compiles them into a
<a href="repodefs.html#refdb">reference database</a>. </li>
 <li> It then looks at all the <a href="repodefs.html#set">sets</a>
and synchronizes them with the services in all the stores:
  <ul>
   <li> Existing services are preserved as they are. </li>
   <li> If a service doesn't appear in the stores, it is removed from all sets. </li>
   <li> If a new service is defined in the stores, it is added to all sets. Services
with the <em>essential</em> flag are added to the <tt>always</tt>
<a href="repodefs.html#sub">sub</a>; services with
the <em>recommended</em> flag are added to the <tt>active</tt> sub; others are added
to the <tt>usable</tt> sub. </li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li> It exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> -v <em>verbosity</em>, --verbosity=<em>verbosity</em> </dt>
 <dd> Be more or less verbose. The default is <strong>1</strong>, which means
that error messages and warnings will be written to stderr. 0 means that only
error messages will be written, and 2 or more adds informational messages.
The option is also passed to commands that s6-rc-repo-sync may call, such
as <a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>, so their verbosity will
be similarly adjusted. </dd>

 <dt> -r <em>repo</em>, --repository=<em>repo</em> </dt>
 <dd> Use the repository in <em>repo</em>, which must exist. Default is
<strong>/var/lib/s6-rc/repository</strong>.
 </dd>

 <dt> -h <em>fdhuser</em>, --fdholder-user=<em>fdhuser</em> </dt>
 <dd> You can safely ignore this option and forget about it. What it does
is ensure that if a supervision tree is started as root on a compiled
database produced by this command, the fd-holder daemon in that
supervision tree runs as <em>fdhuser</em> rather than root. (It is okay
to run that daemon as root.) </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> Success. </dd>
 <dt> 1 </dt> <dd> Failure. Either the services in the listed stores do not make a
consistent reference database, or some set is inconsistent.
With a nonzero <em>verbosity</em>, the error messages from
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a> will be displayed
and detail exactly what went wrong. </dd>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> Incorrect usage. </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> System call failed. This usually signals an issue with the
underlying operating system. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> s6-rc-repo-sync should be called when the contents of the stores have
changed, for instance when the package manager has added packages that define
new services. </li>
</ul>
