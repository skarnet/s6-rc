<h1> The s6-rc-set-commit program </h1>

<p>
 s6-rc-set-commit compiles a <a href="repodefs.html#set">set</a> of services,
ensuring it is ready for installation.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-rc-set-commit [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -r <em>repo</em> ] [ -D <em>defaultbundle</em> ] [ -h <em>fdhuser</em> ] [ -K ] [ -f ] <em>set</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-rc-set-commit checks that no changes have occurred for set <em>set</em> of the
<a href="repodefs.html#repository">repository</a> <em>repo</em> since the last commit, if any. </li>
 <li> It examines all the services in <em>set</em> that are not masked and makes a temporary source
directory with them. It includes all the bundles defined in the <a href="repodefs.html#store">stores</a>, as long
as none of the atomic services composing a bundle is masked. If any service in a bundle is masked,
the bundle does not appear in the database. </li>
 <li> It makes an additional bundle, <em>defaultbundle</em>, based on the
services' <a href="repodefs.html#rx">rxs</a>:
  <ul>
   <li> If a service is <em>masked</em>, it will not appear in the database at all,
and neither will any bundle it's a part of. </li>
   <li> If a service is <em>latent</em>, it will be included in the database, but
not in <em>defaultbundle</em>. </li>
   <li> If a service is <em>active</em> or <em>essential</em>, it will be included
in the database and in <em>defaultbundle</em>. </li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li> It compiles the resulting temporary source directory, by calling
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>, and stores the compiled database
in the repository. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> -v <em>verbosity</em>, --verbosity=<em>verbosity</em> </dt>
 <dd> Be more or less verbose. The default is <strong>1</strong>, which means
that error messages and warnings will be written to stderr. 0 means that only
error messages will be written, and 2 or more adds informational messages. </dd>

 <dt> -r <em>repo</em>, --repository=<em>repo</em> </dt>
 <dd> Use the repository in <em>repo</em>, which must exist. Default is
<strong>/var/lib/s6-rc/repository</strong>.
 </dd>

 <dt> -D <em>defaultbundle</em>, --default-bundle=<em>defaultbundle</em> </dt>
 <dd> This option specifies the name of the bundle that will contain all the active and
essential services. It should be the name that is used to bring up the machine at
boot time when invoking the <a href="s6-rc.html">s6-rc change</a> command. The
default is <strong>default</strong>. </dd>

 <dt> -h <em>fdhuser</em>, --fdholder-user=<em>fdhuser</em> </dt>
 <dd> Specifies <em>fdhuser</em> as the user the fd-holder daemon will run
at if the service database is installed and booted on. The default is
<strong>root</strong>, which is fine, but paranoid users may want to
specify a non-root account. </dd>

 <dt> -K, --keep-old </dt>
 <dd> If this option is given: if there is a previous compiled database for set <em>set</em>,
it will be kept around. On sucess, s6-rc-set-commit will print a line to stdout
that is the path to the old compiled database. You can copy it with
<tt>cp -PR</tt>, move it with <tt>mv</tt> or delete it with <tt>rm -r</tt>.
By default, old compiled databases are not kept &mdash; they're deleted when
a new commit operation succeeds. </dd>

 <dt> -f, --force </dt>
 <dd> Force a new compilation even if a compiled database already exists for
the set and it has not changed since the last commit. By default, when a
compiled version of <em>set</em> exists and is more recent than the last
change to the source version, s6-rc-set-commit notices it and does nothing. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> Success. </dd>
 <dt> 1 </dt> <dd> The set failed to compile. </dd>
 <dt> 3 </dt> <dd> <em>set</em> was not found in the repository. </dt>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> Incorrect usage. </dd>
 <dt> 102 </dt> <dd> Inconsistent repository. </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> System call failed. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> s6-rc-set-commit is essentially a wrapper around <a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>,
that translates a user-oriented view of services ("which services do I want available, and
which do I want started at boot time?"), implemented via rxs, into the source format for
<a href="s6-rc-compile.html">s6-rc-compile</a>, then builds the corresponding service
database. </li>
 <li> s6-rc-set-commit is the ultimate verification step for consistency. When it passes,
the compiled set is ready to be <a href="s6-rc-set-install.html">installed</a>. </li>
</ul>
