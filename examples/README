 An example set of service definition directories.

 It is a real life example, used for the configuration of
a router with 4 ethernet interfaces and 2 wifi ones, behind
two ISPs (one fiber, one DSL), running a few services such
as a DNS cache and a web server for a local network. Each
interface has one IPv4 and two IPv6.

 All the scripts are genuine, only specific values such as
IP addresses are not present (machine-specific data is stored
in /etc, not in the s6-rc source directories).
 The scripts use standard POSIX tools, the whole suite of
skarnet.org tools, and some specialized Linux tools such as
iproute2, iw, etc.

 default is the entry point, i.e. the default bundle containing
all the services that are to be started at boot time. If
you are using s6-frontend, this bundle should not be defined
manually, it will be automatically computed by s6-frontend
from the enabled and essential services in your set.

 Don't look too much into the weird ipv6 stuff, this is a bunch
of workarounds for a very broken ISP-provided device.
