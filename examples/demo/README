0 and 1 are two stores, containing a manually constructed set of
services. They are meant to be used with the repo commands of s6-rc,
or with the s6-frontend package, to help you get familiar with the
commands.

 An uppercase service name means the service is a longrun. A
lowercase one means the service is a oneshot.
 Services named E*|e* are essential.
 Services named R*|r* are recommended, i.e. they should appear as
"active" rather than "usable" by default.
 Services named N*|n* are only "usable" by default.
 Foo-log means the service is a logger for Foo.
 "essentials" is a bundle that every non-essential service should
depend on, in order to only start after all the essential services
are up.
